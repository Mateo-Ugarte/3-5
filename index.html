    <p class="writing"> Steve Jobs is one of the most important people in the history of computers. He was born on February 25, 1955 and died on October 5, 2011. He founded Apple Computer with his friends Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne out of Job's garage. His first computer, the Apple I, was made in 1976. In 1977, he managed to obtain the financing, distribution, and publicity for the company Apple Computer, and thus Apple was created. The same year he launched Apple Computer, he released the Apple II. The Apple II became a huge success,  making Apple $139 million dollars. </p>
